title: Buying a sustainable kettle
---

One morning, my beloved electric kettle stopped working. After 10 years happy breakfast, it retired.
I tried to save it. I opened it, used all my knowledge from engineering school to understand what was wrong. I looked for spare parts online and realized it would cost me more to get them than to buy a brand new one. 
I gave up.
Within minutes, my wife had ordered a new one online (we are heavy tea drinker). This new kettle lasted one month. I sent it back and got refunded.

I took on the quest to find us the perfect electric kettle. My list of requirements was short:

- no plastic in contact with water
- five star reviews from happy customers
- available spare parts to fix it
- made locally
- 1,5L minimum
- cable free

I had no other fancy requirements: I don't need to select the temperature, see the level of water or keep it hot for 3 minutes.

It will be done in 5 minutes, I thought to myself.
2 hours later, I had lost myself in the web vortex of electric kettle. And I could not find any matching my dream criteria.

It's very difficult to find a kettle with no plastic in contact with water.
